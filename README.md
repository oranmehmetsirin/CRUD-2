# CRUD-2

a C.R.U.D. It is the web frontend.

The project was created using Toolkit within the React framework by coding JavaScript with its libraries.

Redux Toolkit aimed to achieve the same result with less code than Redux.

Again, thanks to the Redux Devtools plugin, store, reducer and dispatch actions can be monitored instantly. 

Thus, it was aimed to make the state management in the project easier.

You can review the project content, change its title and content, apply various styling and republish.

The visual of the project is below.
